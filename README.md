# RewardPointsProgram

<h3>Assignment</h3>
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

#
<h3>Summary</h3>

In response to the problem statement, I have developed a Spring Boot application to calculate customer reward points.
This application includes multiple endpoints to efficiently manage the data.
Additionally, I have created test cases, handled exceptions, and implemented Spring Security Authentication to ensure data protection.

For better understanding, the Flow Diagram and ER Diagram are provided in the links below.
All the necessary data to test the application provided in the below links, and the project can also be tested using Swagger UI.
