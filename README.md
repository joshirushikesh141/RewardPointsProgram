# RewardPointsProgram

<h3>Assignment</h3>
A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

#
<h3>Summary</h3>

As per the problem statement, I have created the springboot application program to calculate the reward points of a customer.
In which I have created multiple endpoints which will helpout to work with the data.
Created testcases,handled exceptions and so on. Also applied spring secutity to secure the data.

For better undersatnding, the Project Flow Diagram and ER Diagram attached in below links.
To test project, provided all the required data in last link and also can be tested using Swagger UI.
